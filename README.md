  <b>🔥 Track ALL your parallel Claude sessions. Justify that $200/month. 🔥</b>
</p>

## 💸 The Math That Changes Everything™

**Claude Max ($200/month) - Work harder and reduce your cost virtually**

🧮 Revolutionary Cost Calculation:
- 1 session = $200/month
- 4 parallel sessions = $50/month per session*
- 8 parallel sessions = $25/month per session**
- 16 parallel sessions = $12.50/month per session***
- 32 parallel sessions = PRACTICALLY FREE!****

<sub>* Not actual pricing. You still pay $200/month.</sub>  
<sub>** Still $200/month. But divided by 8 sounds better!</sub>  
<sub>*** Your electricity bill might disagree.</sub>  
<sub>**** CPU has left the chat.</sub>

### 🎯 "The more sessions you run, the cheaper each one becomes!" 
*(Disclaimer: This is not how money works. But it IS how we justify things to ourselves.)*
