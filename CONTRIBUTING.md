2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-logger.git
   cd claude-logger
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/daiokawa/claude-logger.git
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples**
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected**
- **Include your environment details** (OS, Node.js version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List any alternative solutions you've considered**

### Pull Requests

- **Focus on a single concern** - one feature or bug fix per PR
- **Include tests** - ensure your changes are covered by tests
- **Follow the style guidelines** - run linting before submitting
- **Update documentation** - keep README and other docs in sync
- **Add entries to CHANGELOG.md** - document your changes

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. Run linting:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run format:check
   ```

4. Fix linting issues:
   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   npm run format
   ```

## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style:

- **Use ES6+ features** where appropriate
- **Prefer const over let**, never use var
- **Use meaningful variable and function names**
- **Add JSDoc comments** for public functions
- **Keep functions small and focused**

Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` before committing.

### Shell Script Style

For shell scripts, we follow these guidelines:

- **Use shellcheck** to verify scripts
- **Add error handling** with `set -e` where appropriate
- **Use quotes** around variables: `"$var"`
- **Prefer `[[ ]]` over `[ ]`** for conditionals
- **Add comments** for complex logic

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` - Improving structure/format of the code
  - ‚ö° `:zap:` - Improving performance
  - üêõ `:bug:` - Fixing a bug
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` - Introducing new features
  - üìù `:memo:` - Writing docs
  - üöÄ `:rocket:` - Deploying stuff
  - ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` - Adding tests
  - üîß `:wrench:` - Changing configuration files

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run shell script tests
bash __tests__/shell-scripts.test.sh
```

### Writing Tests

- **Write tests for all new features**
- **Maintain or improve code coverage**
- **Use descriptive test names**
- **Follow the AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
- **Mock external dependencies**
- **Test edge cases and error conditions**

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run tests and linting** to ensure everything passes:

   ```

3. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs or added features

4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes under the "Unreleased" section

5. **Push your branch** and create a pull request
